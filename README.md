# DiSKy-Jar-Archives

Hello, and thank you for vising this repository! In here, you can download high-quality archived versions of the DiSky addon from version **3.6.0 ARK** to the latest.

Keep in mind that older version will lack features you might be using, such as modals (introduced at the first alpha release of DiSky V4), voice to text support (introduced at DiSky v4.0.0 I think) and many others.

And also, there might be some versions I have missed. If you want to let me know about a version I've missed, don't hesitate to DM me on Discord: `Cerial#7773`

If you are using DiSky v3, you will not have docs, but [this tool](https://github.com/SkriptHub/SkriptHubDocsTool) will become handy, as it generates documentation for you in JSON format, so you can read it.

Before continuing, I would like to say that if you don't know DiSky to its fullest aspect, then do not use the downloads provided here. Only use the stable versions available either at the [Modrinth page](https://modrinth.com/plugin/disky), or in the [DiSky GitHub repo.](https://github.com/DiSkyOrg/DiSky) The alpha/beta versions will contain bugs as it is not a fully released version.

The purpose of an alpha/beta version is to provide the user with a fix of a bug there might be in the stable release. If you are not having issues, do not download those versions!
